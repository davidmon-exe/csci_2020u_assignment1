## Desription:
* Spam Detector is an application that uses the Bag of words model/Naive-Bayes Spam Filtering to detect which files might be considered spam in a given directory. 

## How to use:
* To use the program execute/run the Java Application. It will bring you to the main screen, where you can select whether to train or test. (Please note that at least one training process must run before test can regognize spam) If train is the wanted process, select the data dir, and then select train. If test is the wanted process, select the data dir, then select test.

## Improvements:
* Changed font sizes, background and shading with style\
* Added an image
* Accuracy and Precision are much higher than that of the sample output, showing that the training model may be more robust
